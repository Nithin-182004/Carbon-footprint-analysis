## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the carbon footprint of households based on features such as electricity usage, natural gas consumption, vehicle miles, house size, and lifestyle factors. The dataset provided includes a training set (`train.csv`) with 14,000 rows and a test set (`test.csv`) with 6,000 rows, containing 19 features and a target variable (`carbon_footprint`) in the training set. The task is a regression problem, and the evaluation metric is the R² score.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Numerical columns with missing or non-numeric values (e.g., `f)0*7` in `house_area_sqft`) were converted to numeric using `pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')`, and missing values were imputed with the median from the training set. Binary columns were imputed with the mode.
   - **Handling Invalid Data**: Negative values in columns like `electricity_kwh_per_month` and `water_usage_liters_per_day` were clipped to 0. Invalid categorical values in `heating_type` (e.g., `;[8K4`) and `diet_type` were replaced with the training set mode. `home_insulation_quality` was clipped to the range [0, 7].
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables (`heating_type`, `diet_type`) were one-hot encoded using `pd.get_dummies(..., drop_first=True)` to avoid multicollinearity.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **New Features**:
     - `electricity_per_person`: Electricity usage per household member (`electricity_kwh_per_month / household_size`).
     - `water_per_person`: Water usage per household member (`water_usage_liters_per_day / household_size`).
     - `energy_inefficiency`: House area divided by insulation quality plus one (`house_area_sqft / (home_insulation_quality + 1)`), capturing energy inefficiency due to poor insulation.
   - These features were designed to capture per-capita resource usage and structural efficiency, which are likely correlated with carbon footprint.

3. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Numerical features, including engineered features, were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure consistent scales for model training.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - An XGBoost regressor (`XGBRegressor`) was chosen due to its robustness to noisy data, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and strong performance in regression tasks.
   - Hyperparameters: `n_estimators=200`, `learning_rate=0.05`, `max_depth=6`, `random_state=42`.

5. **Training and Validation**:
   - The training data was split into 80% training and 20% validation sets using `train_test_split(..., test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`.
   - The model achieved a validation R² score of 0.8965 (Scaled Score: 89.65), indicating strong predictive performance.

6. **Prediction and Submission**:
   - The test set was preprocessed identically to the training set, ensuring feature consistency.
   - The `ID` column was preserved for the submission file, and predictions were generated using the trained model.
   - The submission file (`submission.csv`) contains two columns: `ID` and `carbon_footprint`, with 6,000 rows.

## Feature Engineering Details
- **Rationale**:
  - `electricity_per_person` and `water_per_person` normalize resource usage by household size, capturing individual-level consumption patterns.
  - `energy_inefficiency` accounts for the interaction between house size and insulation quality, as larger homes with poor insulation likely contribute more to carbon emissions.
- **Impact**: These features improved model performance by providing more granular insights into household behavior and structural characteristics.
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding of `heating_type` (electric, gas, none) and `diet_type` (omnivore, vegetarian, vegan) captured the impact of energy sources and dietary habits on carbon footprint.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, one-hot encoding).
  - `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`: Feature scaling.
  - `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`: Splitting data into training and validation sets.
  - `xgboost.XGBRegressor`: Training the regression model.
  - `sklearn.metrics.r2_score`: Evaluating model performance.
- **Environment**: Anaconda (or similar Python environment) for managing dependencies.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE (e.g., VS Code) for coding and debugging.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Noisy Data**: The dataset contained non-numeric values, negative values, and invalid categories. These were handled by coercing to numeric, clipping, and imputing with appropriate statistics.
- **Feature Alignment**: Ensured test set features matched training set features using `reindex`, filling missing columns with zeros.
- **ID Column Preservation**: An initial `KeyError` occurred due to dropping the `ID` column prematurely. This was fixed by storing the `ID` column before preprocessing and using it for the submission file.

## Conclusion
The approach combines robust preprocessing, targeted feature engineering, and a powerful gradient boosting model to achieve a high R² score. The code is modular and reproducible, handling the dataset's noise effectively. Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning or exploring additional features (e.g., interaction terms).
